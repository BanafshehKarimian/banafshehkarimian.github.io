In this project we want to make the turtle in turtlesim move as our face moves and control it with our face. In order to do so, we define a new massage coordinate_msg that contains the x and y coordinate of a face. Check it using:
```console
rosmsg show package_name/coordinate_msg
```
The sendfacetracker.py file is a publisher which finds the face using haarcascade and publishes the middle point of the found face using coordinate_msg. You can test it using:
```console
rosrun package_name sendfacetracker.py
rostopic echo /coordinate
```
<br /> Next the subscriber node is coded in calculaternode.py which receives the coordinate of the face and the position of the turtle. It then publishes the speed the turtle need to move through calculating the distance of pose to its required location corresponding to the face.
<br />You can launch the project using:
```console
roslaucn package_name pckg_lauch.launch
```
<br />The followings are the rqt_graph and a sample movement of the turtle.<br />
