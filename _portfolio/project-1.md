<p align="justify"> We evaluated different approaches for detecting which key of the screen keyboard does the user looks at. We first used Canny and Hue algorithms for detecting the eye pupil, but due to the bas quality of web-cam images this method was not accurate.
Then we applied a CNN on both real and artificial datasets generated by <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/unityeyes/">Cambridge unity eye</a>. The resulting method achieved an accuracy of 54 percents detecting the area between 8 candidate areas of the screen. </p>
