<p align="justify"> Aim of this project was to apply multiple hierarchical classification algorithms on UCI heart disease dataset to achieve a good performance. The first layer of the classifiers separate only healthy from unhealthy individuals, and the second layer classifier predicts the heart problem of the individuals labeled as unhealthy by the first layer classifier. NeuralNetwork, Regression, DecisionTree and other algorithms were applied and the full results are shown in the following link.</p>
