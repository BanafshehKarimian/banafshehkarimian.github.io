<p align="justify"> Refractive errors problem means that the eye has some problems in the ability of focusing light and therefore results to a blurred vision. Uncorrected refractive errors are the first reason of low-vision and the
second cause of curable blindness in the world. Machine-learning algorithms can, therefore, be used as an
effective method to determine the causes of refractive errors. We collected a dataset of 500 individuals eye health state as well as some features indicating their lifestyle, family history and other personal information. This dataset can be found <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Refractive+errors">at UCI repository</a>. After gathering the required data and some statistical analysis of the data, we used multiple algorithms to detect influential factors who effect mostly on the eyes health state and predict it using models with high accuracy.
A full documentation of the analysis in Persian can be found <a href="https://banafshehkarimian.github.io/files/Refractive.pdf">here</a> </p>
