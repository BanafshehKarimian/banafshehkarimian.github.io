One of the most effective approaches to improve the accuracy
of classification systems is ensemble systems; However, selecting the best combination
of individual classifiers is a challenging task. To address this issue we proposed our system MEGA, standing for using MEta-learning and a Genetic Algorithm for algorithm recommendation. MEGA has three main components: Training,
Model Interpretation and Testing. The Training component extracts meta-features of each training dataset and uses a genetic
algorithm to discover the best classifier combination. The Model Interpretation component interprets the relationships between
meta-features and classifiers using a priori and multi-label decision tree algorithms. Finally, the Testing component uses a
weighted k-nearest-neighbors algorithm to predict the best combination of classifiers for unseen datasets. For more information you can read our paper [MEGA predicting the best classifier combination using meta-learning and a genetic algorithm](https://).
