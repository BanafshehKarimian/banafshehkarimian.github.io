<p align="justify"> Classifier combination through ensemble systems is one of the most effective approaches to improve the accuracy
of classification systems. Ensemble systems are generally used to combine classifiers; However, selecting the best combination
of individual classifiers is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an efficient assembling method that employs both
meta-learning and a genetic algorithm for the selection of the best classifiers. Our method is called MEGA, standing for
using MEta-learning and a Genetic Algorithm for algorithm recommendation. MEGA has three main components: Training,
Model Interpretation and Testing. The Training component extracts meta-features of each training dataset and uses a genetic
algorithm to discover the best classifier combination. The Model Interpretation component interprets the relationships between
meta-features and classifiers using a priori and multi-label decision tree algorithms. Finally, the Testing component uses a
weighted k-nearest-neighbors algorithm to predict the best combination of classifiers for unseen datasets. We present extensive
experimental results that demonstrate the performance of MEGA. MEGA achieves superior results in a comparison of three
other methods and, most importantly, is able to find novel interpretable rules that can be used to select the best combination of
classifiers for an unseen dataset. </p>
